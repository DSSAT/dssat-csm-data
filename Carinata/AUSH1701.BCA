! Do not trust the PWAM, BUT lacking grain yield.  Why?
! This is totally metric.  Weights are kg/ha. 
! TRNO 1 is AX17012 and TRNO2 is Avanza-641
! Definitions of headers
! ADAT - Day of year of anthesis
! CHTA - final canopy height (m), from final harvest information
! PD1T - Day of year of first pod
! HIPM - from small sample at harvest
! PWAM - CWAM (TWO DATES) TIMES FINAL HIPM.  DO NOT REALLY TRUST THIS
